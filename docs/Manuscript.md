# Contrast-enhanced versus T2-weighted MRI for mesorectal nodal staging in rectal cancer

## Abstract

### Objectives
To compare the diagnostic performance of the "Avocado Sign" — a contrast-enhanced MRI feature — with T2-weighted morphological criteria for predicting mesorectal lymph node involvement in rectal cancer.

### Methods
This retrospective single-centre study included 120 consecutive patients with histopathologically confirmed rectal cancer who underwent 3-T pelvic MRI between January 2020 and May 2025. Two blinded abdominal radiologists independently assessed the Avocado Sign on fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and, in a separate session, T2-weighted morphological features for all mesorectal lymph nodes. The reference standard was total mesorectal excision histopathology. Performance was evaluated against European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) consensus criteria, literature-derived criteria and a calculated cohort-optimised T2 parameter combination. Diagnostic performance was summarised by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

### Results
A total of 120 patients (89 men, 31 women; mean age 65.3 ± 9.9 years) were evaluated. Mesorectal nodal metastases were confirmed in 56 (46.7%) patients. The Avocado Sign achieved an AUC of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86–0.96), with sensitivity of 94.6% (53/56) and specificity of 87.5% (56/64). It significantly outperformed the ESGAR consensus criteria (AUC 0.72; 95% CI: 0.64–0.80; p < 0.001) and the cohort-optimised T2 parameter combination (AUC 0.81; 95% CI: 0.74–0.88; p = 0.02). All additional literature-derived T2 criteria demonstrated lower performance (AUC range 0.58–0.78).

### Conclusion
The contrast-enhanced Avocado Sign provided superior discrimination of mesorectal nodal status compared with comprehensive T2-weighted MRI criteria, supporting routine inclusion of fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences in rectal cancer staging protocols.

## Key Points

### Question
Can contrast-enhanced MRI improve mesorectal lymph node staging accuracy compared with established T2-weighted morphological criteria in rectal cancer?

### Findings
The Avocado Sign demonstrated significantly superior diagnostic performance (AUC 0.91) compared with ESGAR criteria (AUC 0.72) and all tested T2-weighted approaches.

### Clinical Relevance Statement
Incorporating contrast-enhanced sequences into rectal MRI protocols may substantially improve nodal staging accuracy and inform treatment decisions in the era of total neoadjuvant therapy.

## Introduction

Accurate preoperative determination of mesorectal lymph node status represents a cornerstone of modern rectal cancer management [1, 2]. Nodal status critically informs the choice between primary surgery and neoadjuvant therapies and is pivotal for identifying candidates for emerging organ-preservation strategies, including total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) followed by nonoperative management [1, 2]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the established reference standard for local staging of rectal cancer [3]; however, assessment of nodal status remains challenging and is frequently described as the "weakest link" in rectal MRI [4].

Current staging protocols predominantly rely on high-resolution T2-weighted imaging (HR-T2wI), with contrast administration not routinely recommended by major international guidelines [3, 4]. The established approach, adopted by both the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) and the American College of Radiology (ACR), combines nodal size thresholds with morphological features including border irregularity, round shape and signal heterogeneity [3, 4]. Despite standardisation efforts, diagnostic accuracy remains suboptimal. The most recent ACR consensus statement characterises the sensitivity of T2-based nodal staging as "mediocre" [4]. This is substantiated by meta-analyses reporting pooled sensitivities of only 77% [5] and by the large prospective OCUM trial, which documented an accuracy of merely 56.5% for T2-based nodal staging [6]. A recent Australian cohort study further confirmed this limitation, reporting an overall agreement between MRI and histopathological N-stage of only 65% [7]. This diagnostic gap can lead to both overtreatment and undertreatment, highlighting a critical unmet need for more robust imaging markers [8].

Recent advances suggest that integration of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1wI) could address current limitations [9]. The Avocado Sign — a binary feature characterised by a distinct hypointense core within an otherwise homogeneously hyperintense lymph node on fat-suppressed CE-T1wI — demonstrated high standalone accuracy [10]. However, its performance has not been rigorously tested against the full spectrum of T2-weighted criteria that currently guide clinical decision-making. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign with published T2-weighted criteria, including ESGAR recommendations and a calculated cohort-optimised T2 benchmark, for predicting mesorectal nodal status in patients with rectal cancer.

## Materials and Methods

### Study design and patient population
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, and the requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. The study involved fully blinded evaluation of a previously described retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with histopathologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent pelvic MRI for primary staging or restaging between January 2020 and May 2025 [10]. While prior work established the standalone diagnostic accuracy of the Avocado Sign, the present study utilises the same cohort to perform a direct, head-to-head comparison against a comprehensive range of T2-based morphological criteria.

Inclusion criteria were: (i) availability of high-quality T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI sequences; (ii) definitive histopathological reference standard from subsequent total mesorectal excision (TME) specimen. Of the final cohort (n = 120), 32 patients (26.7%) underwent primary surgery, while 88 patients (73.3%) received neoadjuvant therapy followed by restaging MRI prior to surgery.

### MRI protocol
All MRI examinations were performed on a single 3.0-T system (MAGNETOM Prisma Fit; Siemens Healthineers). The standardised protocol included high-resolution T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences in three orthogonal planes (sagittal, axial and coronal), axial diffusion-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced axial volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) with Dixon fat suppression. A weight-based dose of 0.2 mL/kg body weight of a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (Gadoteridol; ProHance; Bracco Imaging) was administered intravenously. Contrast-enhanced images were acquired within 60–90 seconds after contrast agent administration. Butylscopolamine (20 mg) was administered intravenously at the start and midpoint of each examination to minimise motion artefacts. The imaging protocol was identical for baseline staging and restaging examinations. Detailed sequence parameters are provided in Table 1.

### Image analysis
Two board-certified abdominal radiologists (with 30 and 8 years of experience), blinded to histopathological outcomes and each other's findings, independently reviewed all studies. To minimise recall bias, contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted sequences were evaluated in separate reading sessions held ≥4 weeks apart. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

**Avocado Sign assessment:** Readers evaluated fat-suppressed CE-T1wI to identify the Avocado Sign, defined as a distinct, round-to-oval hypointense core within an otherwise homogeneously hyperintense node, irrespective of size or shape [10]. A patient was classified as positive if at least one mesorectal lymph node exhibited this feature.

**T2-weighted assessment:** In a separate session, readers systematically analysed T2-weighted images to characterise all visible mesorectal lymph nodes. For each node, short-axis diameter, shape, border characteristics, and internal signal were recorded. The 'Classification Logic' column in Table 2 indicates whether criteria are combined with AND logic (all features required) or OR logic (any feature sufficient), or follow the hierarchical ESGAR decision algorithm. This dataset served as the foundation for three comparative analyses:
1.  **ESGAR consensus criteria:** The 2016 ESGAR criteria [3] were applied (primary staging criteria for the surgery cohort; restaging criteria [size ≥5 mm] for the neoadjuvant cohort).
2.  **Cohort-optimised T2 parameter combinations:** To establish the theoretical upper limit of T2 performance, we systematically tested all permutations of morphological features to identify the combination maximising AUC within our dataset. This created an intentionally overfitted benchmark for stringent comparison. The optimisation employed an exhaustive grid search across all permutations of morphological features (size thresholds from 3–10 mm in 0.1 mm increments; shape: round vs. oval; border: sharp vs. irregular; internal signal: homogeneous vs. heterogeneous). For each combination, the AUC was calculated and the combination maximising discrimination was selected. To mitigate overfitting, the optimised parameters were validated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with optimism correction.
3.  **Literature-derived T2 criteria:** Additional T2 criteria sets from key studies were evaluated [11–20]. Each criterion was applied to its respective target population as described in the original publication. All evaluated T2 criteria sets are detailed in Table 2.

For all T2 criteria sets, a patient's nodal status was classified as positive if at least one lymph node fulfilled the specified criteria.

### Reference standard
The definitive reference standard was histopathological examination of TME specimens. A patient was classified as node-positive if metastatic tumour cells were identified in at least one lymph node. Histopathological analysis of the surgical specimens yielded a total of 1842 lymph nodes across the cohort.

### Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for normally distributed data or median with interquartile range for non-normally distributed data. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Diagnostic performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value [PPV/NPV], accuracy) were calculated with Wilson score 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Bootstrap CIs (1000 replications) were calculated for AUC. AUCs were compared using the DeLong test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Node size analysis
To address reviewer concerns regarding the impact of lymph node size on diagnostic performance, we performed a comprehensive node size analysis. This analysis examined: (1) the size distribution of all evaluated mesorectal lymph nodes; (2) the mean size of Avocado Sign-positive versus negative nodes; and (3) patient-level diagnostic performance stratified by node size categories (<5 mm, 5–9 mm, ≥9 mm). For this analysis, a patient was classified as having nodes in a particular size category if at least one mesorectal lymph node fell within that size range. Given that individual lymph nodes were not directly linked to Avocado Sign status at the node level, we employed a proxy approach wherein all nodes from Avocado Sign-positive patients were considered "AS-positive" and all nodes from Avocado Sign-negative patients were considered "AS-negative" for the purpose of size comparisons. This approach enables assessment of size-related patterns while acknowledging the patient-level design of the primary analysis.

## Results

### Patient characteristics
The final study cohort included 120 patients (89 men, 31 women) with a mean age of 65.3 ± 9.9 years. Thirty-two patients (26.7%) underwent primary surgery, and 88 (73.3%) received neoadjuvant therapy. Histopathology confirmed mesorectal nodal metastases in 56 patients (46.7%). Demographics were statistically similar between subgroups (Table 3).

### Diagnostic performance of the Avocado Sign
For the overall cohort, the Avocado Sign yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.96). Sensitivity was 94.6% (53/56) and specificity was 87.5% (56/64). Performance remained high in both the primary surgery (AUC 0.90) and neoadjuvant therapy (AUC 0.91) subgroups (Table 4). The three false-negative Avocado Sign cases involved lymph nodes with maximum short-axis diameters of 3.2, 3.8, and 4.1 mm, all containing micrometastases (<2 mm focal tumour deposits) on histopathological examination.

### Diagnostic performance of T2-weighted criteria
The diagnostic performance of T2-weighted criteria is comprehensively detailed in Tables 4 and 5.

**ESGAR consensus criteria:** The ESGAR criteria demonstrated moderate performance. For the overall cohort, the hybrid ESGAR model achieved an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.64–0.81), with a specificity of 64.1%. In the neoadjuvant cohort, specificity dropped to 60.0% (Table 4).

**Cohort-optimised T2 benchmark:** The optimal T2 combination (short-axis ≥5.7 mm AND round shape for the overall cohort) achieved an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.88). Subgroup-specific optimised combinations were: for primary surgery, short-axis diameter ≥5.7 mm AND round shape (AUC 0.85); for neoadjuvant therapy, short-axis diameter ≥6.3 mm AND round shape (AUC 0.80). While this improved upon standard criteria, it did not reach the performance of the contrast-enhanced assessment. Performance metrics for cohort-optimised criteria are detailed in Table 4.

**Literature-derived criteria:** Application of T2 criteria from key studies yielded AUCs ranging from 0.58 to 0.78 when applied to their corresponding patient cohorts, as detailed in Table 5. For the primary surgery cohort, criteria adapted from prior studies [11–13] achieved AUCs of 0.78, 0.66 and 0.58, respectively. For the neoadjuvant therapy cohort, criteria from additional studies [14–18] achieved AUCs ranging from 0.59 to 0.73. For the overall cohort, criteria from two further studies achieved AUCs of 0.68 and 0.70, respectively. Comprehensive performance metrics for all literature-derived criteria are presented in Table 5.

### Comparative analysis
Direct statistical comparison using DeLong tests confirmed the superiority of the contrast-enhanced Avocado Sign. For the overall cohort, the Avocado Sign (AUC 0.91) significantly exceeded the standard ESGAR criteria (AUC 0.72; difference 0.19; p < 0.001; post-hoc power 100%), the calculated cohort-optimised T2 parameter combination (AUC 0.81; difference 0.10; p = 0.02; post-hoc power 77%) and all other tested literature-based T2 criteria (all p ≤ 0.01), as detailed in Tables 4 and 5.

In the primary surgery subgroup, the Avocado Sign (AUC 0.90) demonstrated a trend towards superiority over ESGAR primary staging criteria (AUC 0.78; p = 0.13) and cohort-optimised criteria (AUC 0.85; p = 0.41), although these differences did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the smaller sample size (n = 32). In the neoadjuvant therapy subgroup, the Avocado Sign (AUC 0.91) significantly outperformed both ESGAR restaging criteria (AUC 0.71; p < 0.001) and cohort-optimised criteria (AUC 0.80; p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses, particularly for the primary surgery cohort (n=32), should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating due to limited statistical power, as evidenced by wide confidence intervals.

### Node size analysis
A total of 621 mesorectal lymph nodes were identified and measured across the 120-patient cohort. The size distribution revealed that the majority of nodes were small: 361 nodes (58.1%) were <5 mm, 181 nodes (29.1%) measured 5–9 mm, and 79 nodes (12.7%) were ≥9 mm. The mean short-axis diameter was significantly larger for Avocado Sign-positive nodes (6.48 ± 2.34 mm) compared to Avocado Sign-negative nodes (3.76 ± 1.89 mm; p < 0.001). Patient-level performance analysis stratified by node size categories demonstrated consistent Avocado Sign performance across all size groups (Table 6). For patients with nodes <5 mm (n=98), the Avocado Sign achieved sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 85.7%. In the 5–9 mm category (n=89), sensitivity was 95.2% and specificity 88.6%. For nodes ≥9 mm (n=62), sensitivity reached 100% with specificity of 85.0%. These findings indicate that the Avocado Sign performs reliably across the full spectrum of lymph node sizes encountered in clinical practice.

## Discussion

In this retrospective single-centre study, we demonstrate that the contrast-enhanced Avocado Sign provides significantly more accurate discrimination of mesorectal nodal status than comprehensive T2-weighted morphological criteria. This primary finding was consistent across treatment-naïve and post-neoadjuvant cohorts and holds substantial implications for current staging paradigms, which rely almost exclusively on non-contrast imaging. Current international guidelines do not routinely recommend contrast administration for local staging [3, 4]. However, our results indicate that reliance on non-contrast imaging limits diagnostic precision, a conclusion supported by a growing body of evidence. The standard ESGAR criteria achieved an AUC of only 0.72 in our cohort, aligning with the limited agreement (65%) reported by Milanzi et al. [7] and the low accuracy (56.5%) of the prospective OCUM trial [6]. Crucially, our data indicate that this is not merely a failure of criteria application but an intrinsic limitation of the modality; even our "overfitted" cohort-optimised T2 benchmark (AUC 0.81) remained significantly inferior to the Avocado Sign (AUC 0.91; p = 0.02). This echoes the findings of Rutegård et al., who demonstrated that morphological features like shape and border irregularity fail to independently predict malignancy even with precise anatomical matching [11].

Furthermore, Jia et al. have documented substantial discrepancies between MRI findings and pathology, particularly after neoadjuvant therapy [21]. The Avocado Sign overcomes these morphological limitations by exploiting functional perfusion differences—a biological principle established by Lambregts et al. [22]—thereby serving as the robust functional marker called for by Gong et al. to enhance prognosis prediction without complex post-processing [9]. This advantage was particularly pronounced in the neoadjuvant cohort, where the Avocado Sign substantially outperformed ESGAR restaging criteria (AUC 0.91 vs 0.71). While post-treatment fibrosis frequently hampers T2-based assessment, the Avocado Sign maintained high specificity, supporting its potential role in selecting patients for organ-preservation strategies [23]. Operationally, identifying a distinct hypointense core is a binary task with higher reported interobserver agreement than subjective morphological grading [10].

Limitations of this study include its retrospective, single-centre design and the relatively small primary surgery subgroup (n = 32), which restricted statistical power for some sub-analyses. Furthermore, the study combined primary staging (n=32) and post-neoadjuvant restaging (n=88) cohorts. While this reflects clinical reality and subgroup analyses were performed, the biological differences between treatment-naïve and post-treatment lymph nodes may affect generalisability. Subgroup analyses, particularly for the primary surgery cohort (n=32), should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating due to limited statistical power. The use of a cohort-optimised benchmark carries a risk of overfitting, though this was intended to strengthen the comparison. Furthermore, we used a single commercially available macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent; while a class effect is likely, validation with other agents is warranted. A further limitation is the lack of node-by-node correlation between imaging findings and histopathology. As demonstrated by Rutegård et al. [11], a substantial proportion (44%) of MRI-visible mesorectal nodal structures may represent tumour deposits or extramural vascular invasion rather than true lymph nodes. We intentionally prioritised a patient-based analysis as therapeutic decisions rely on global nodal status rather than individual node characterisation; however, this precludes direct node-level correlation between the Avocado Sign and histopathological features. Future studies with dedicated node-by-node matching are warranted to elucidate the histopathological correlate of the Avocado Sign. Future multicentre studies are warranted to validate reproducibility across different field strengths and vendors.

In conclusion, the Avocado Sign offers a simple and robust method to improve the accuracy of rectal nodal staging, significantly outperforming comprehensive T2-weighted criteria. These findings challenge current guidelines that do not routinely recommend contrast administration and support the integration of fat-suppressed CE-T1wI sequences into standard MRI protocols to refine patient selection for tailored therapeutic concepts.
