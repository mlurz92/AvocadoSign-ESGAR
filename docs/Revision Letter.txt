Dear Dr. Lurz,

Peer-review of your manuscript has now been completed. Major Revisions are requested before a final decision can be reached. Please find the comments below.

"Manuscript requirements for submissions"
Before you revise your manuscript, please carefully read the updated requirements as they outline the must-haves and show how to further improve your manuscript:
https://www.european-radiology.org/for-authors/submission-guidelines/

Pay attention to:
- Correctly structure your key points as outlined below:
1. Question (20-25 words) - Explain the unmet need/clinical problem your study addresses
2. Findings (20-25 words) - Objectively summarize your main result
3. Clinical Relevance Statement (maximum 40 words) - summarize the benefit for the patient and/or clinical
- Correctly format the bibliography
- Check that all keywords are exactly as they appear in the MeSH database
- Delete all geographical information (city, country) for commercial names

Make sure to adhere to these and the following instructions to facilitate the processing and decision process of your revised manuscript!

* * * * * * *
Your revision *must* contain the following items:

1) Author's Response to Reviewers' Comments:
A file (Author's Response to Reviewers' Comments) containing the editor's and reviewers' suggestions with your specific responses to each of the comments. This file must be editable (preferred format: MS Word)

2) Revised & Clean Main document:
One document with visible changes to the previous version, highlighted by using the 'track changes' option ("Main text_marked"). One document with all changes accepted ("Main text_clean")

3) Other revised & clean documents:

4) Graphical Abstract (if your submission is an Original Article):
All Original Articles must contain a Graphical Abstract following the journal template (available on "Submission guidelines" page).

When uploading your revised manuscript:
- Select from the previous submission all files that haven't changed and include it in the revision.
- Delete/de-select any redundant files.
- Upload all new (revised & clean) files and use a clear file name (e.g. "Main text_marked", "Main text_clean" or "Table 1_marked", "Table 1_clean").

COMMENTS TO AUTHORS:

Reviewer #1: Dear Author,
Some comments on your study.
Could you describe in more details the method used for cohort optimization. How did you reach the presented cut offs? Did you test different combinations of imaging features? How many features per combination? What was the statistical method used to validate that?
In table 2 there is a column on the right named "classification Logic" but you don´t comment on that in the text.
Could you include images of head to head comparisons of T2 images and avocado sign images? If possible showing a case of false negative T2 image with a positive avocado sign image.




Reviewer #2: General Comments
This manuscript addresses a clinically important question comparing the Avocado Sign with T2-weighted criteria for nodal staging in rectal cancer. The study is well-written and the results are promising.
However, some methodological concerns require attention. I acknowledge that the authors transparently discussed limitations in their original Avocado Sign publication (Reference 10), including single-center design, single contrast agent, and need for external validation.
Major Issues

1. Cohort Overlap with Original Publication
The study cohort (n=120) substantially overlaps with the original Avocado Sign cohort (Reference 10, n=106), representing only 13% expansion. This raises concerns about validation independence.
Please clarify: (1) which patients were added and why, (2) whether the same radiologists evaluated both cohorts, and (3) how this overlap affects interpretation of comparative results.

2. Cohort-Optimised T2 Benchmark Methodology
The T2 benchmark was created by testing all permutations of morphological features on the same cohort where it was subsequently evaluated. Although the authors acknowledged as "intentionally overfitted," this approach inflates the benchmark's apparent performance (AUC 0.81) and may bias the comparison either artificially narrowing or widening the difference with the Avocado Sign depending on interpretation.
Suggestion: Implement k-fold cross-validation for the optimized benchmark, or present it only as sensitivity analysis while using externally-derived criteria as the primary comparison.

3. Absence of Lymph Node Size Analysis
The manuscript states that no minimum size threshold was applied, but does not report lymph node size distribution or performance stratified by size (e.g.: <5mm, 5-9mm, ≥9mm). This is critical, since ESGAR criteria incorporate size thresholds and small nodes are notoriously difficult to assess.
Please provide: (1) size distribution of evaluated nodes, (2) mean size of Avocado Sign-positive versus negative nodes, and (3) diagnostic performance stratified by node size if possible.

4. Statistical Power for Subgroup Analyses
The primary surgery subgroup (n=32) has limited statistical power, as evidenced by wide confidence intervals (AUC 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78-1.00) and non-significant comparisons (p=0.13).
Suggestion: Present subgroup analyses as exploratory/hypothesis-generating, or remove formal statistical comparisons for underpowered subgroups.

5. Node-by-Node Correlation
The per-patient approach limits understanding of what the Avocado Sign represents histopathologically. Rutegård et al. (Eur Radiol 2025) showed that 44% of MRI-identified nodal structures were tumor deposits or EMVI rather than lymph nodes.
Suggestion: Discuss this limitation explicitly and consider node-by-node analysis in a subset for future studies.

6. Heterogeneous Population
Combining primary staging (n=32) with post-neoadjuvant restaging (n=88) in a unified analysis is problematic given biological and imaging differences between these populations.
Suggestion: Present separate analyses as co-primary endpoints; the combined analysis could serve as secondary/pooled analysis.

7. Contrast Timing Not Specified
The manuscript states images were acquired "immediately after" contrast administration without specifying exact delay in seconds or enhancement phase.
Required: Please specify precise timing for protocol reproducibility.


Minor Issues
- Interobserver agreement: The study references κ=0.92 from the original publication. Demonstrating reproducibility for both methods in this cohort would strengthen the comparison.
- Typographical error: Section 9 contains "casdiagnostic study"—please correct.
- False-negatives: Please characterize the 3 false-negative cases (micrometastases? small nodes?).
- Demographics: Consider adding T-stage distribution, tumor location, and neoadjuvant regimen details.
